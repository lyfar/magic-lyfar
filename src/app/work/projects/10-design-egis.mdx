## Executive Summary

We partnered with Egis Group's architecture line 10 Design to create an authentic brand film and photo library capturing everyday collaboration inside their Hong Kong studio. Over three half-day shoots the crew documented real-time project reviews, model making and client interactions. The final deliverables – a two-minute hero video, six social cut-downs and a bank of 120 retouched stills – armed the marketing team with fresh content that lifted LinkedIn engagement by 45 percent in the first month and strengthened Egis' employer-brand positioning across Asia-Pacific.
