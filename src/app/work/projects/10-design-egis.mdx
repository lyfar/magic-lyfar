## Project Brief

We partnered with Egis Group's 10 Design to create an authentic brand film and photo library capturing everyday collaboration inside their Hong Kong studio. Filmed over three half-day shoots documenting real-time project reviews, model making, and client interactions for their website.

## Approach

- **Minimal Disruption**: Filmed during live project work with tight meeting schedules.
- **Authentic Workflow**: Captured genuine moments of design collaboration and creative process.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Documented open office spaces, VR room, model workshop, and client presentations.

## Deliverables

Raw footage was color-graded, selected, and cropped to deliver a complete content package for their website and marketing materials.
