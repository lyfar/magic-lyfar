## Project Brief

We spent two days with Edoardo Rocco, Balenciaga's President for Asia Pacific, filming an in-depth interview and candid behind-the-scenes moments. The piece was produced exclusively for Balenciaga's internal communications, offering insight into the brand's regional vision and upcoming initiatives.

## Approach

- **Compact Crew**: Operated with a minimal footprint to keep the setting intimate.
- **Fashion-Focused Cinematography**: Used soft lighting and prime lenses to capture Balenciaga's aesthetic.

## Result

The final video serves as an internal inspiration piece, highlighting leadership perspective and brand direction across Asia Pacific.
