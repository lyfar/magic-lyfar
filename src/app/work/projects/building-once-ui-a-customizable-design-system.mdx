## Overview

Development of a modern, scalable e-commerce platform featuring a React-based frontend, Node.js backend, and integrated payment processing for a seamless shopping experience.

## Key Features

- **Frontend Application**: Built a responsive React application with Next.js, featuring product browsing, search functionality, shopping cart, and user authentication.
- **Backend API**: Developed a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, handling user management, product catalog, order processing, and inventory management.
- **Database Design**: Implemented a PostgreSQL database with optimized queries and proper indexing for fast product searches and efficient order processing.
- **Payment Integration**: Integrated Stripe payment processing with secure checkout flows and webhook handling for order confirmations.
- **Real-time Features**: Added WebSocket functionality for live inventory updates and order status notifications.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with JWT tokens
- **Payments**: Stripe API integration
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), Railway (backend), CloudFlare (CDN)

## Challenges and Learnings

One major challenge was implementing real-time inventory management to prevent overselling during high-traffic periods. The solution involved implementing optimistic locking in the database and using Redis for caching frequently accessed product data. Additionally, handling payment processing securely while maintaining a smooth user experience required careful implementation of webhook handling and error recovery.

## Outcome

The platform successfully handles thousands of concurrent users with sub-200ms response times. It features a 99.9% uptime record and has processed over $500K in transactions. The modular architecture allows for easy scaling and the addition of new features, making it a robust foundation for future e-commerce projects.
