## Approach

- **Intimate Kitchen Setting**: Utilized Ermano's private kitchen to create an authentic, personal cooking environment.
- **Professional Production**: Complete pre-production planning, professional lighting setup, and voice recording.
- **Educational Focus**: Structured filming to capture clear instructional content for pasta and sauce preparation.
- **Series Format**: Designed as part of a larger cooking series showcasing Italian culinary traditions.
