## Project Overview

A fast, end-to-end prototype of an HSBC-style digital assets experience built with Flutter. This project was developed as part of a technical assessment to demonstrate Flutter capabilities and rapid prototyping skills. It explores adaptive Material/Cupertino design, mock authentication, market browsing, asset details with a chart, a buy flow with review/confirmation, a portfolio view with recent activity, and persistent theme settings.

## Context & Purpose

This prototype was created as part of a technical assessment to showcase:
- **Flutter Development Skills**: Demonstrating proficiency in Dart and Flutter framework
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Built in approximately 4 hours to validate UX flows
- **Cross-Platform Delivery**: Works seamlessly on mobile and web platforms
- **Financial UI/UX**: Experience with complex financial interfaces and user flows

## What This Prototype Demonstrates

### Design & UX
- Adaptive UI: Material Design + Cupertino components with shared elements
- Brand-Inspired Design: HSBC-style interface (visual inspiration only)
- Responsive Layout: Optimized for both mobile and web experiences

### Authentication Flow
- Mock Authentication: Emulated login process with staged loading states
- State Streaming: Real-time state updates during authentication
- Error Handling: Graceful error states and retry mechanisms

### Market & Trading Features
