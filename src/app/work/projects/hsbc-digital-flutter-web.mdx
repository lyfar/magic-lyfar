## Project Overview

In collaboration with HSBC Digital's director in Hong Kong, we developed a prototype demonstrating how digital currencies could be seamlessly integrated into HSBC's investment platform. The prototype was built using Flutter to ensure rapid development and cross-platform compatibility, allowing us to showcase the concept on both web and mobile platforms.

### 1. Design Philosophy

We carefully followed HSBC's existing design language and user experience patterns from their current banking and investment apps to ensure our prototype would feel familiar to existing HSBC customers. Key considerations included:

- **Brand Consistency**: Adhered to HSBC's color palette, typography, and UI components
- **Familiar Navigation**: Mirrored existing HSBC app navigation patterns
- **Security First**: Incorporated HSBC's standard security UI patterns
- **Investment Focus**: Aligned with existing investment product presentation

### 2. Technical Implementation

| Component | Technology Choice | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Framework** | Flutter | Cross-platform capability, native performance |
| **Architecture** | Clean Architecture | Scalable, maintainable codebase |
| **State Management** | Provider | HSBC's preferred pattern |
| **UI Components** | Custom Flutter Widgets | Matching HSBC's design system |

### 3. Key Features

**Portfolio Integration**
- Digital currency holdings alongside traditional investments
- Real-time value tracking and performance metrics
- Portfolio allocation visualization

**Investment Features**
- Digital currency trading interface
- Investment tracking and history
- Market analysis tools
- Risk assessment indicators

**Educational Content**

- Regulatory compliance information

### 4. Development Process

1. **Research Phase**
   - Analyzed existing HSBC investment app
   - Studied competitor digital currency offerings
   - Identified key user journeys

2. **Design Phase**
   - Created high-fidelity wireframes
   - Developed interactive prototypes
   - Validated with stakeholders

3. **Development Phase**
   - Built core functionality in Flutter
   - Implemented responsive design
   - Created demo data layer

4. **Testing & Refinement**
