## Project Overview

Hypebeast Asia invited friends to a private housewarming at Dead Poets bar. We documented the night and produced a series of short cinematic stories showcasing their customized bottles and the bar's atmosphere.

A fast-cut version of the edit is also available: [watch here](https://portfolio.lyfar.com/hypebeast_housewarming_fast-compressed.mp4).

## Highlights

- **Event Coverage**: Shot over a single evening in a documentary style.
- **Brand Aesthetic**: Focused on the bottles' design and ambient lighting.

The videos were released across Hypebeast's social channels, adding energy to their community launch in Hong Kong.
