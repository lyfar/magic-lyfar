## Project Overview

We collaborated with Sauce Barbershop, our friends and partners in Dead Poets collective, to create their comprehensive digital presence. This partnership extended beyond just website development - we supported them from concept to delivery, providing end-to-end solutions for their Hong Kong barbershop.

### Our Partnership with Dead Poets

Working alongside our Dead Poets collective, we developed a strong partnership with Sauce Barbershop, understanding their vision to blend cuts, culture, and style in the heart of Hong Kong's SoHo district. This collaboration represents the creative synergy that emerges when like-minded creatives unite around a shared vision.

### Technical Innovation

The website showcases cutting-edge web technologies to create an immersive user experience:

- **Clip-Path Effects**: Innovative CSS techniques for unique visual transitions
- **Text Segmentation**: Custom sliced text effects where fragmented elements reunite during navigation

**Frontend Architecture**
Built with modern web standards using Next.js and TypeScript for optimal performance:

```typescript
// Advanced scroll-triggered text reunification
const textAnimation = {
  segments: splitText(element),
  trigger: useScrollTrigger(),
  transform: 'scale(-1, 1)', // Mirrored segments
  reunion: animateToCenter()
}
```

### Key Features

**Dynamic Text Effects**
The signature feature involves text elements that appear fragmented but elegantly reunite as users scroll, creating a metaphor for the barbershop's community-building mission.

**Responsive Design**
Mobile-first approach ensuring optimal experience across all devices, crucial for Hong Kong's mobile-heavy user base.

**Performance Optimization**
- Lottie animations for lightweight, scalable graphics
