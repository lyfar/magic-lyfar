## Project Brief

We were commissioned by emerging clothing brands Vasco and Newwave to produce a dynamic teaser video for their upcoming joint party in Hong Kong. The goal was to build anticipation and excitement for the event among a young, fashion-forward audience.

## Approach

- **Restaurant Production**: Filmed in a restaurant setting with professional lighting and microphones for controlled quality.
- **Hong Kong Central Walking Shots**: Captured additional b-roll footage walking through Hong Kong Central to showcase the urban energy.
- **Professional Setup**: Used pro lighting and audio equipment to ensure high production value for the teaser.

## Deliverables

A 1-minute teaser video optimized for social media platforms to promote the upcoming party event.
